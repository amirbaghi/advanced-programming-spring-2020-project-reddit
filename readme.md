## AP Course Project: Reddit
This is a description for Shiraz University's Advanced Programming 2020 Spring Course, which was decided and planned to be system similar to Reddit.

### Project Overview
As a project for this course of AP, the gradery team has decided that a system similar to **Reddit** to be compeletely impleneted (Back-end and Front-end). This project is only intended as a good practitcal experience for the students and is **not mandatory**. Those who participate and carry out this project are given *bonus scores and recommendations from the gradery team to the instructor directly*. Even though such bonuses are proportional to the level or scale of implenetation, all efforts are appreciated; so please do participate!

### Submission
To provide the individuals participating with *an experience for working with Git*, *Forking*, *Contributing to existing repositories on GitHub thorugh Pull Requests (the way Open-Source projects are done)*, the team has decided that this repository will act as the main and source repo, and to participate and implement the project, you would have to **fork this repo**, work on it (according to the workflows that you would have to read about, such as Fork-and-Branch), and in the end **submit a Pull Request to this repo**; so that the team would then examine the requests (with probably presentation from yourselves) and then grade them accordingly.<br /> Best PR would then be decided by the team and would be merged with this repo (which would reamin as a good history for you, retaining your name and project for your own personal work history). Keep in mind that **the PRs would not be removed**, and they will also be kept in the history of this repo; So even if your PR is not merged with the mater of this repo, your project and your request would still be available in this repo and would be a great refernce point in your work history.<br/>

Note: *Only PRs from students of this course are accepted.*

### Project Requirements
As said before, this project is intended to be simliar to Reddit, so any feature that is now available on Reddit, if implemented, is a step towards our goal, though *not all features are necessary for an acceptable submission*.<br />
With that being said, we think that the system should support the following description and requirements (for further questions into the features, see how reddit currently supports those - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)):
In this system, we have four main components: **User**, **Subreddit**, **Post**, and **Comments**.

#### User
Our system should have Users (Redditors) and also have a user management system (login and signup). Users can follow and message eachother. They should also have the ability to own and join a Subreddit (Optional: they can also be appointed as a Mod (Moderator) of a Subreddit or if owner, appoint one). Users can also post in Subreddits they own or have joined.

#### Subreddit
Each Subreddit has a name and a description (Optional: also a picture). Each Subreddit contains a number of Posts which are posted by the users of that Subreddit.

#### Post
Each Post has a title. The Post's content can be text, image or both text and image (Image is Optional). Posts can also be shared with other users. Each post has a score assigned to it (initially zero). Also, each post can be either *Upvoted* or *Downvoted* by a user. When upvoted, the score is incremented (Score + 1). When downvoted, the score is decremented (Score - 1). Also each post has a number of Comments.

#### Comment
Each comment has a content, which is text. Comments also have a score system just like posts (Upvotes & Downvotes). Each comment can be replied to. The replies also have the same properties as comments so they can also be replied and given a score.


#### Searching
The system should support searching for a subreddit, a post *in a subreddit*, and a user. For more info on how it's done, visit Reddit.


#### Pages
The system should support the following pages in its user interface: Login/Signup Page, Home Page, Subreddit Page, Post Page.
A brief description of the content of such pages is as follows:
- Login/Signup Page
	A regular login or signup page to support such features
- Home Page
	Shows all of User's followed Subreddits' top Posts by score (Optional: add sort by recent, hot, and etc.)
- Subreddit Page
	Subreddit's Posts by score (Optional: again sorting the posts)
- Post Page
	Post's title, text (and image if supported), and comments (Try to show comments and their replies as threads) 


### Project's User Interface
The User Interface for the project is totally up to you. Two main options that we can think of are **Text User Interface (TUI, Terminal)** & **JavaFX**. The team suggests that you use JavaFX, due to its ease and the great tools that it provides you with to make a high-level UI for desktop and mobile apps, though its learning is *primarily up to you*.


## UPDATE ON PROJECT STATUS
The submissions for this project were received today, which is July 28, and they were reviewed and accepted.
The submissions were overall amazing and wonderful, and you can view them for yourself in the Fork section of this repository.
It was hard to choose a repository among them to merge with master, since they were all so great, but to act on our promise, the repository belonging to @mohammadjahandide was chosen as the one. Again this doesn't mean that other submissions weren't worthy of a merge. Another repository which we think you should view is the one belonging to @pouyateimoury, who did a great job working on this project.
As an ending note, the gradery team of AP Spring 2020 would like to thank you all for participating in this project, and we're hoping you've gained a fair amount of experience working on this project. Good luck to you all!
